# REACT - Tic Tac Toe

#### Fetching and Updating data 

> the exercise in this project was about:</br>
>> build a tic tac toe game with useState</br>
>> managed and derived state</br>
>> setting and getting Data from localStorage</br>
>> flexible localStorage Hook</br>
>> game history feature</br>

> ##### Managed State 
>> - State that you need to explicitly manage </br>

> ##### Dervived State
>> - State that you can calculate based on other state</br>

> ##### State mutation
You don't want to mutate the state that's being managed, since it can lead to unexpected bugs</br>
React relies on the fact that anytime there is a state change, it triggers a rerender. </br>
by mutating things, it could have some stale closures that are refrencing the mutated values.</br>

#### React APP
> Run the app from the main folder - npm start</br>
> runs on localhost:3000</br>
